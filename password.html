            <h1>Pwned Passwords</h1>
            <p>
                Pwned Passwords are hundreds of millions of real world passwords
                previously exposed in data breaches. This exposure makes them
                unsuitable for ongoing use as they're at much greater risk of being
                used to take over other accounts. They're searchable online below as
                well as being downloadable for use in other online systems. Read more
                about how HIBP protects the privacy of searched passwords.

                <h4>Password reuse and credential stuffing</h4>
                <p>
                    Password reuse is normal. It's extremely risky, but it's so common
                    because it's easy and people aren't aware of the potential impact.
                    Attacks such as credential stuffing take advantage of reused
                    credentials by automating login attempts against systems using known
                    emails and password pairs.
                </p>

                    NIST's guidance: check passwords against those obtained from previous
                    data breaches
                </h4>
                <p>
                    The Pwned Passwords service was created in August 2017 after NIST
                    released guidance specifically recommending that user-provided
                    passwords be checked against existing data breaches. The rationale for
                    this advice and suggestions for how applications may leverage this
                    data is described in detail in the blog post titled Introducing 306
                    Million Freely Downloadable Pwned Passwords. In February 2018, version
                    2 of the service was released with more than half a billion passwords,
                    each now also with a count of how many times they'd been seen exposed.
                    A version 3 release in July 2018 contributed a further 16M passwords,
                    version 4 came in January 2019 along with the "Collection #1" data
                    breach to bring the total to over 551M. Version 5 landed in July 2019
                    with a total count of 555M records, version 6 arrived June 2020 with
                    almost 573M then version 7 arrived November 2020 bringing the total
                    passwords to over 613M. The final monolithic release was version 8 in
                    December 2021 which marked the beginning of the ingestion pipeline
                    utilised by law enforcement agencies such as the FBI.

                <h4>Downloading the Pwned Passwords list</h4>
                <p>
                    The entire set of passwords is downloadable for free below with each
                    password being represented as either a SHA-1 or an NTLM hash to
                    protect the original value (some passwords contain personally
                    identifiable information) followed by a count of how many times that
                    password had been seen in the source data breaches. The list may be
                    integrated into other systems and used to verify whether a password
                    has previously appeared in a data breach after which a system may warn
                    the user or even block the password outright. For suggestions on
                    integration practices, read the Pwned Passwords launch blog post for
                    more information. At present, the downloadable files are not updated
                    with new entries from the ingestion pipeline, use the k-anonymity API
                    if you'd like access to these. Please download the data via the
                    torrent link if possible! If you can't access torrents (for example,
                    they're blocked by a corporate firewall), use the "Cloudflare" link
                    and they'll kindly cover the bandwidth cost. The bandwidth costs of
                    distributing this content from a hosted service is significant when
                    downloaded extensively. Cloudflare kindly offered to support this
                    initiative by aggressively caching the file at their edge nodes over
                    and beyond what would normally be available. Their support in making
                    this data available to help organisations protect their customers is
                    most appreciated.
